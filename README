A file syncer developed in Python.

I lost a hard drive with all my old programming stuff on there, so I wanted to prevent that from happening again.

I also have three machines that I program on, so I want to be able to have all my scripts available to me with whatever machine I'm working on.

There are lots of bugs to still work out, and I'm currently using rsync to transfer data (sorry windows), but I'd like to rewrite these portions in python.

It watches a folder, looks for changes, and syncs them to a drive. 


TODO:

Allow disabling of tray icon so a user can run it as a script in the background and forget about it.

Windows / Mac support (develop rsync commands in Python)

Try to implement some local delta-transfer to see if it's faster.
